a) num=[22,25,33,46,50,55,69,70,74,80,86]
i)
----hi=10, lo=0, therefore mid as 5 is checked and found to be lower
----hi=10, lo=6, therefore mid as 8 is checked and found to be higher
----hi=7, lo=6, therefore mid as 6 is checked and found to be equal
THEREFORE it takes THREE iterations of binary search to find 69

ii)
linear serach will take 7 iterations to find 69, therefore binary search in this instance is twice as fast relatively


b) num=[152,87,24,8,12,17,20,78,112]
---- LO=0, HI=8, C=[152]
---- LO=1, HI=8, C=[152,112]
---- LO=1, HI=7, C=[152,112,87]
---- LO=2, HI=7, C=[152,112,87,78]
