// a) Pseudo-random numbers = deterministic algorithm generating seemingly random sequence,
// used for simulating randomness in computer programs.
// b) "Seed a random-number generator" = initialize starting point for sequence of pseudo-random numbers. 
//Without seed, generator produces same sequence every time. 
//Seed based on non-deterministic value (e.g. current time) makes sequence more unpredictable and random-like.
